##This project utilizes BeautifulSoup4 to scrap and strip news articles and collect there title and a brief synopsis of the article.
##If there is no data to be gotten from the article that the URL provides, then it will flash an error saying so.
##The code is written out and annotated in a legible and useful format for future editors.
##This program uses Python3.9,BeautifulSoup4 and requests packages to perform its tasks.
>To try different urls, please put the urls on there own individual line in the "urls.txt"file provided. The program reads each line as an independent url so this is important.
